## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[W3 school, youtube and google.com]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[What was challenging in this project? I had a bit hard time creating a gif file using the provided link Recordit. I was able to record my gif
, but after I copied and past the link to the readme.md file it was not showing up is supposed to be. I tried many different ways to make it work, but 
there was no luck, so I came across a new application that I had to download to my pc, shareX. Using the shareX app, I created the 
gif file and got the working link.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[When I came across this question, I always wondered why there are too many coding platforms there for the same purpose. 
I mean, we have Java, c++, python, etc. I always ask most of my teachers which language is the best or has more demand in 
the market, and most of the time I will get a response saying Java has more demand in the market, so I you gave me a 
chance to ask you, I will ask you the same thing which language has more demand in the market?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Suppose I have a few more times to upgrade this project. In that case, I will work on adding playtime, adding an image to the 
buttons when I click a button to show me a picture like the music sign, and I will put three failing tries; I will 
add a winning surprise gift and try to add players' names and information. There are many more options to add, but 
I was limited with time to get my project done. The most important I will say is to add a playing time limit.]
